<div class="header"><div class="title">C. Social Distance</div><div class="time-limit"><div class="property-title">time limit per test</div>2 seconds</div><div class="memory-limit"><div class="property-title">memory limit per test</div>256 megabytes</div><div class="input-file input-standard"><div class="property-title">input</div>standard input</div><div class="output-file output-standard"><div class="property-title">output</div>standard output</div></div><div><p>Polycarp and his friends want to visit a new restaurant. The restaurant has $$$n$$$ tables arranged along a straight line. People are already sitting at some tables. The tables are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in the order from left to right. The state of the restaurant is described by a string of length $$$n$$$ which contains characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" (the table is occupied) and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" (the table is empty).</p><p>Restaurant rules prohibit people to sit at a distance of $$$k$$$ or less from each other. That is, if a person sits at the table number $$$i$$$, then all tables with numbers from $$$i-k$$$ to $$$i+k$$$ (except for the $$$i$$$-th) should be free. In other words, the absolute difference of the numbers of any two occupied tables must be strictly greater than $$$k$$$.</p><p>For example, if $$$n=8$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then:</p><ul> <li> strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10010001</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10000010</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">00000000</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">00100000</span>" satisfy the rules of the restaurant; </li><li> strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10100100</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">10011001</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">11111111</span>" do not satisfy to the rules of the restaurant, since each of them has a pair of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" with a distance less than or equal to $$$k=2$$$. </li></ul><p>In particular, if the state of the restaurant is described by a string without "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" or a string with one "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>", then the requirement of the restaurant is satisfied.</p><p>You are given a binary string $$$s$$$ that describes the current state of the restaurant. It is guaranteed that the rules of the restaurant are satisfied for the string $$$s$$$.</p><p>Find the maximum number of free tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant. Formally, what is the maximum number of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" that can be replaced by "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" such that the requirement will still be satisfied?</p><p>For example, if $$$n=6$$$, $$$k=1$$$, $$$s=$$$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">100010</span>", then the answer to the problem will be $$$1$$$, since only the table at position $$$3$$$ can be occupied such that the rules are still satisfied.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases in the test. Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le k \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of tables in the restaurant and the minimum allowed distance between two people.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains a binary string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" — a description of the free and occupied tables in the restaurant. The given string satisfy to the rules of the restaurant — the difference between indices of any two "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" is more than $$$k$$$.</p><p>The sum of $$$n$$$ for all test cases in one test does not exceed $$$2\cdot 10^5$$$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case output one integer — the number of tables that you can occupy so as not to violate the rules of the restaurant.
