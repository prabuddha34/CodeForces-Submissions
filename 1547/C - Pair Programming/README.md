Now they decided to try pair programming.</p><p>It's known that they have worked together on the same file for $$$n + m$$$ minutes. Every minute exactly one of them made one change to the file. Before they started, there were already $$$k$$$ lines written in the file.</p><p>Every minute exactly one of them does one of two actions: adds a new line to the end of the file or changes one of its lines.</p><p>Monocarp worked in total for $$$n$$$ minutes and performed the sequence of actions $$$[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$$$. If $$$a_i = 0$$$, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If $$$a_i  \gt  0$$$, then he changes the line with the number $$$a_i$$$. Monocarp performed actions strictly in this order: $$$a_1$$$, then $$$a_2$$$, ..., $$$a_n$$$.</p><p>Polycarp worked in total for $$$m$$$ minutes and performed the sequence of actions $$$[b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]$$$. If $$$b_j = 0$$$, then he adds a new line to the end of the file. If $$$b_j  \gt  0$$$, then he changes the line with the number $$$b_j$$$. Polycarp performed actions strictly in this order: $$$b_1$$$, then $$$b_2$$$, ..., $$$b_m$$$.</p><p>Restore their common sequence of actions of length $$$n + m$$$ such that all actions would be correct — there should be no changes to lines that do not yet exist. Keep in mind that in the common sequence Monocarp's actions should form the subsequence $$$[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n]$$$ and Polycarp's — subsequence $$$[b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m]$$$. They can replace each other at the computer any number of times.</p><p>Let's look at an example. Suppose $$$k = 3$$$. Monocarp first changed the line with the number $$$2$$$ and then added a new line (thus, $$$n = 2, \: a = [2, 0]$$$). Polycarp first added a new line and then changed the line with the number $$$5$$$ (thus, $$$m = 2, \: b = [0, 5]$$$).</p><p>Since the initial length of the file was $$$3$$$, in order for Polycarp to change line number $$$5$$$ two new lines must be added beforehand. Examples of correct sequences of changes, in this case, would be $$$[0, 2, 0, 5]$$$ and $$$[2, 0, 0, 5]$$$. Changes $$$[0, 0, 5, 2]$$$ (wrong order of actions) and $$$[0, 5, 2, 0]$$$ (line $$$5$$$ cannot be edited yet) are not correct.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><div class="section-title">Input</div><p>The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$). Then $$$t$$$ test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.</p><p>Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains three integers $$$k$$$, $$$n$$$, $$$m$$$ ($$$0 \le k \le 100$$$, $$$1 \le n, m \le 100$$$) — the initial number of lines in file and lengths of Monocarp's and Polycarp's sequences of changes respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \le a_i \le 300$$$).</p><p>The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m$$$ ($$$0 \le b_j \le 300$$$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><div class="section-title">Output</div><p>For each test case print any correct common sequence of Monocarp's and Polycarp's actions of length $$$n + m$$$ or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span> if such sequence doesn't exist.</p></div><div class="sample-tests"><div class="section-title">Example</div><div class="sample-test"><div class="input"><div class="title">Input<div title="Copy" data-clipboard-target="#id005254920598996459" id="id0010612879090752292" class="input-output-copier">Copy</div></div><pre id="id005254920598996459">5
